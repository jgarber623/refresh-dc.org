<p>For our last meetup of 2007, <a href="http://www.onelittlewindow.org/">Doug Wilson</a> and <a href="http://www.onelittlewindow.org/">Mark Bristow</a> will present a high level overview of why those developing web applications should worry about security. They will also provide suggestions for avoiding common vulnerabilities discovered in the past year.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re planning on attending, please send your name (and names of any guests) to contact at refresh-dc dot org. This will help us get a list of names to the door man. Thanks!</p>

<p>John Sutton, a Senior Information Architect (IA) and Interaction Designer (IxD) at <a href="http://www.navigationarts.com/">NavigationArts</a>, will be presenting an overview of Information Architecture and Interaction Design practices, and he will introduce some concepts that are in play today within the conversation circles of the practice.</p>

<p>Join us for what should be a fantastic discussion. Come early (~6:45pm) for food and drink, meeting starts at 7:00pm sharp!</p>

<p>The Motley Foolâ€™s offices are located on Duke Street just across from the King Street Metro station on the Yellow/Blue lines (take the tunnel!).</p>

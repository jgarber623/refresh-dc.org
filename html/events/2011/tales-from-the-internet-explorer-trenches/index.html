<p>This month, <a href="http://about.me/evansamek">Evan Samek</a>, Lead Designer at local startup <a href="https://www.hellowallet.com/">Hello Wallet</a>, brings to us some serious tales from the Internet Explorer trenches. Focusing specifically on the beast that is IE6, Evan will cover common errors you might encounter when wrangling IE6. He’ll also show off some tools that can be used to ease the pain and identify some hidden ways to replicate CSS3 support for versions of Internet Explorer that don’t support it. In addition to the discussion about JavaScript polyfills, Evan will discuss how certain implementation practices can improve performance.</p>

<p>We’re excited for Evan’s talk and hope that you are, too! Our friends at <a href="http://clearspring.com/">Clearspring</a> have generously offered to provide food and drinks for everyone. <a href="http://www.apcoworldwide.com/">APCO Worldwide</a> has opened their doors to us this month by offering to host the meeting. They’re located just north of Metro Center on 12th St. NW.</p>

<p>The meeting starts at 7pm, but feel free to come out a little early to grab some food and socialize. We’ll be heading out for the usual drinks and catching up afterwards, so stick around.</p>

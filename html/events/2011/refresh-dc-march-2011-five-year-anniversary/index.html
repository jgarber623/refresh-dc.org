<p><strong>This month, Refresh DC turns five years old!</strong></p>

<p>To mark the occasion, we’ll be taking a look back at the history of Refresh both here in DC and around the country (and world!). We’ll also be looking ahead and setting a course for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>We’ve got a few things planned, but the majority of this month’s meeting will be a group discussion. We encourage everyone to come prepared with ideas for how we can make Refresh DC better. General topics of discussion might include:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are some topics you’d be interested in learning about or presenting on?</li>

<li>What’s the best method of notifying people of upcoming events?</li>

<li>How can we better connect with the larger DC Tech community?</li>
</ul>

<p>The fine folks at <a href="http://www.aarp.org/">AARP</a> are hosting us again this month. They’ve played a big part in Refresh DC’s history over the last couple of years and we’re thankful that they’ve once again opened their doors to us.</p>

<p>We’re looking forward to seeing everyone on the 22nd!</p>

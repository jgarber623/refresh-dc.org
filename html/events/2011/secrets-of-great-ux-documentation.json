It helps move the design process forward, capturing decisions made or requirements learned. It allows the team to move onto the next set of decisions. Great documentation establishes a comfort level with team members, telling them, **“We have the same idea about where this project is going.”**\n\nIn this month’s Refresh DC, **Dan Brown**, author of [Communicating Design](http://communicatingdesign.com/) and co-founder of [Eightshapes](http://www.eightshapes.com/), will explain the evolving role of formal documentation in a design process that continually reinvents itself. He'll offer practical tips for making documents easier to read, easier to produce, and relevant throughout the design process."}

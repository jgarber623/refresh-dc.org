<p>We’re closing out another great year with our annual Holiday Happy Hour! This year, we’ll be gathering at <strong><a href="http://breadandbrew.com/">Bread &amp; Brew</a></strong> located at <strong>1247 20th St. NW</strong>. They have a fantastic selection of drinks and amazing food.</p>

<p>To help us celebrate, we’ve lined up some great sponsors to assist with the bar tab. The plan is to have a Refresh DC tab that we can enjoy until we use it up.</p>

<p>Thanks again for making 2011 a great year and we’re looking forward to seeing you!</p>

<p><strong>Update: Supporting CodeNow</strong></p>

<p>We’ve lined up enough sponsors to make the Holiday Happy Hour a great time. If you’re still interested in sponsoring, though, we ask instead that you consider donating to <a href="http://codenow.eventbrite.com/?discount=refreshdc">CodeNow</a>, a DC-grown non-profit focused on developing the next pioneers in technology by teaching underrepresented high school students foundational skills in computer programming. They’re collecting donations for a bootcamp to be held at the end of December.</p>

<p>The type you use in your design will say as much to your audience as the actual words on the page, but, up to now, Web designers have an extremely limited palette of fonts to choose from. All design is about overcoming the limitations of the medium, and Web design is no different. In this session, Jason will show you how to use fluid typography, browser-safe fonts, and type on images to create robust scalable designs without having to resort to type in images or Adobe Flash. We’ll also take a look at how CSS allows you to download any font you want to use in your Web designs, and how to begin using downloadable fonts now.</p>

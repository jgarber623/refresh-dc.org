<p>Last month, we saw how Nguyet Vuong moves from a design concept toward a final, client-approved comp. This month, Jason Garber will show you how he transforms this same comp into standards-based, accessible markup and code. Heâ€™ll talk about a variety of techniques that help not only maintain the integrity of the comp, but also incorporate best practices, search-friendly markup, and improve the user experience overall.</p>

<p>Refresh DC founder and organizer emeritus Jason Garber is no stranger to the web. As a front-end developer at Mixx, and previously at AOL, Jason has been around the block a few times when it comes to web standards, and it shows in the work he produces. When not working out a great text editor, Jason is shedding on other axes: his guitar and camera.</p>

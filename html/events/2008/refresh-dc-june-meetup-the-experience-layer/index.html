<p>Flash has no place in a web standards toolkit. Or does it? Dan Mall, the Interactive Director at Happy Cog, will demonstrate how Flash can be used to to enhance a user’s experience, why it can be successful, and how to make a case for it. We’ll be meeting on our normal night (Same Bat Time), but at a new venue downtown (New Bat Channel) – hope you’ll all be able to make it out!</p>

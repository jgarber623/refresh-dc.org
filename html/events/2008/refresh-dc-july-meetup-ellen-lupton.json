She is director of the Graphic Design MFA program at Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) in Baltimore, where she also serves as director of the Center for Design Thinking. Ellen will be presenting her talk: “Design Is Driving Me Crazy: Crimes Against Typography and Other Rants.”\n\nIn addition to being an AIGA Gold Medal winner, the highest honor in the field of graphic design, Ellen has written several books that strive to bring the tools and techniques of typography and graphic design to a wider audience, including Thinking With Type (2004) and D.I.Y.: Design It Yourself (2006).\n\nWe’ll be meeting at Boston University’s Center for Digital Imaging Arts campus in Georgetown. They’ve got a great space, and you should be able to get there fairly easily from the Rosslyn or Foggy Bottom metro stops, or by taking the Circulator or 30s buses from the District."}

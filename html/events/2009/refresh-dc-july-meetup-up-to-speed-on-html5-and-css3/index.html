<p>As modern browsers begin to support the emerging HTML5 and CSS3 standards, and products like Google’s Chrome OS are being built around their capabilities, they are beginning to become more relevant to designers and developers.</p>

<p>Refresh DC organizers Jason Garber and Jackson Wilkinson will walk through these two new technologies, how they may impact the emerging web, and how you can begin to use certain pieces right now.</p>

<p>As UI Architect at Mixx.com, and previously at AOL, Jason has been around the block a few times when it comes to web standards, and it shows in the work he produces.</p>

<p>Jackson, User Experience Strategist at Viget Labs, been building websites for fifteen years as a front- and back-end developer, and has been watching the development of HTML5 and CSS closely, contributing to the development of HTML5, and currently uses both regularly.</p>

<p>We’ll be back at AARP this month to take advantage of their great venue, and then we’ll head out for drinks at Rocketbar afterward.</p>

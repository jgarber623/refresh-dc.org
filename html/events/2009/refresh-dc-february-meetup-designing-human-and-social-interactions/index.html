	<div class="description">
		<p>To design an interaction you must commit to writing a narrative of human behavior mediated through time and space. It is the interaction and interface designer’s job to understand how social media ecosystems are likely to evolve, given the interaction of the application constraints with users - each of which with their own goals, prejudices, social ties, needs for sociality and irrational decision-making. We will discuss social media strategy in the context of design choices affecting application design, functions, as well as user centricity of social media design, the unique attributes of online communication which can only steer individual and aggregate participation within the social network through cues, incentives and community enforced social norms. We will discuss strategy and design patterns in social media site architecture/design and their impact on human behavior and walking away you should be equiped with a framework to tackle the design and implementation of sociality on social networking systems.</p>

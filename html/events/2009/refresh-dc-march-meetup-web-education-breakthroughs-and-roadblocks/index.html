<p>Educational institutions teaching web related disciplines have recently come into focus. Many schools’ programs are outdated, teaching software specific non standards based curriculum. The web job market has transformed into many sub-facets so quickly that many institutions hoping to update don’t know where to begin. There are many things already happening to facilitate growth in education in regard to the web arena, however, there are some major hurdles that need addressed as well. Jeffrey will explain some great things already in motion and where help is needed, in addition to how can you help to implement change. All professionals, educators and non, have a vested interest in our future.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Brown teaches website design at Damascus High School in Montgomery County, MD. He writes curriculum for web related courses in Montgomery County Public Schools and teaches adult education courses for teachers wanting to refresh their skills in the web. Jeffrey is also an adjunct professor at Montgomery College where he professes the goodness of web standards.</p>

<p>As a part of the Web Standards Project’s Education Task Force he worked on the InterAct Curriculum and works to promote standards awareness to educators. He enjoys designing and coding as much as he does teaching.</p>

<p>Since we missed April’s meeting (no venue! sadness!), we might as well meet up this week for a drink or two until May’s proper meeting comes around.</p>

<p>Join us at Rocketbar in Chinatown for an evening of socializing, mingling, and what-have-you with the best and brightest minds in the DC web scene, and a few other people might show up too.</p>

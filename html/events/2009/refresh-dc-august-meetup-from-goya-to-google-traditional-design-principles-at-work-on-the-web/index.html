<p>This month, Refresh DC regular and Ironworks Art Director Corey Greeneltch will be presenting From Goya to Google: Traditional Design Principles at Work on the Web … Or, “Everything I needed to know about Web Design I learned in Art History Class”. I’ll show how traditional art utilizes foundational design principles and discuss how we use these ancient techniques for success on the web.</p>

<p>We’ll once again be at AARP, where food and beverage will be provided by the awesome folks at BOALT.</p>

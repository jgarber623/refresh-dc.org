<p>Oooh, That’s Clever! (Unnatural Experiments in Web Design) Find inspiration in the ridiculous. See technological quirks as opportunities.

<p>All the way from the UK, Paul Annett is Clearleft’s visual design lead. At this year’s SXSW he entertained the crowd with a magic trick and a live-action stage-show of a website, in this presentation which changed the way people design sites. He has worked as a freelance web designer, a TV production assistant, and a magician. These things taught him the art of smoke and mirrors. So far no-one has rumbled him.</p>

<p>We’ll be back at the National Digital Library Learning Center (located in the first floor of the Madison Building - through the front doors and straight ahead) for August’s meeting.</p>

<p>This month’s presentation will be brought to us by Jackson Wilkinson of <a href="http://www.grassroots.com/">Grassroots Enterprise</a>. He’ll be presenting on Microformats, a hot (and sometime divisive) new means of tagging information in webpages.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, comments, or tips regarding Microformats, post them on our <a href="http://refresh-dc.org/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=148">forum</a> and we’ll address them in the presentation.</p>

<p>The closest Metro stop is Capitol South and you can find an excellent area map <a href="http://refresh-dc.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=32#p119">here</a>.</p>

<p>July’s Refresh DC meeting will again be at the National Digital Library Learning Center (located in the first floor of the Madison Building - through the front doors and straight ahead).</p>

<p>This month will be all about podcasts. You’ve probably seen the menu item in the iTunes Music Store and wondered what it was all about. Well we encourage you to come out to the meeting and we’ll cover the ins and outs of podcasting, both audio and video.</p>

<p>The closest Metro stop is Capitol South and you can find an excellent area map <a href="http://refresh-dc.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=32#p119">here</a>.</p>

Instead of not doing anything this month, we’ve decided to host a happy hour just before people leave town. Unlike Most Holiday Parties, This One Will Be Free!\n\nThis year’s happy hour is open to any generous folks that would want to help sponsor the bar tab. Sponsorship opportunities are still available and will only help make this party a notch above the rest.\n\nJoin us on Thursday, December 16th for drinks at the downtown Capitol City Brewing location (New York Ave NW & 11th St NW). It's one block from the Metro Center stop on the Red, Blue and Orange Lines.\n\nUpdate: A big thanks to all of our awesome bar sponsors and continued interest in sponsoring this event! Rest assured, there will be plenty of food & drink sponsorship opportunities for events throughout the new year (including one for our 5 year anniversary)."}

<p>As a fair portion of our membership might be still recovering from SXSW, we’ll be keeping things fairly low-key this month, forgoing a presentation and focusing on the social side of Refresh DC. Captial City Brewing Company will be the location of this month’s meetup, where you can expect to find some quality beverages and fine conversations. Located on the corner of 11th &amp; H Streets NW. Closest Metro station is Metro Center.</p>

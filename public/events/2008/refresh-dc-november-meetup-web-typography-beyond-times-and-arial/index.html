		<p>The type you use in your design will say as much to your audience as the actual words on the page, but, up to now, Web designers have an extremely limited palette of fonts to choose from. All design is about overcoming the limitations of the medium, and Web design is no different. In this session, Jason will show you how to use fluid typography, browser-safe fonts, and type on images to create robust scalable designs without having to resort to type in images or Adobe Flash. We&#8217;ll also take a look at how CSS allows you to download any font you want to use in your Web designs, and how to begin using downloadable fonts now.</p>

<p>Jason Cranford Teague is the Director of Web Design Standards for AOL Global Programming, overseeing design and development of one of the largest sites on the Web. He is also a member of the W3C’s CSS Working Group, on the advisory board for Sessions.edu, and regularly contributes software reviews to Macworld Magazine. As if that wasn’t enough to keep him busy, he is also the Internet Strategist for Yuri’s Night (yurisnight.net) the World Space Party. Jason writes books (mostly so he can remember how to do all of this stuff) including the best selling CSS, DHTML, and Ajax Visual Quick-start Guide (Peachpit Press) and is working on a new book, Speaking in Styles: A CSS Primer for Web Designers (www.speaking-in-styles.com). He lives with 2 cats and 2 kids, but only the one wife.</p>

Join us for a very special Wednesday Night edition of Refresh DC. We’ll be avoiding conflict with Thursday’s TechCocktail, and we’ll have a nicely-sized venue right next to the Virginia Square Metro (between Clarendon and Ballston) courtesy of this month’s venue sponsor.

We’ll have a panel of personalities from the DC startup scene, including Andrew Lee of Publi.us (who still all work in a house, literally), Sean Greene of LaunchBox Digital, Eddie Frederick of Hungry Machine, Brian Williams of Viget Labs, and Eric Rupert of Odeo.

It’ll be an hour of discussion around the challenges of starting your own business, and thoughts on the advantages and disadvantages of the different ways to do it. It should be an interesting time!

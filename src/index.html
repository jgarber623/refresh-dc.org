<p>Refresh DC is a community of web designers, developers, and other new media professionals working together to refresh the creative, technical, and professional aspects of their trades in the Washington, DC, area.</p>
<p><em>Our goal is simple:</em> bring together the best and brightest new media professionals in the DC metro area so that we may learn from one another. Our industry is too rich for any one person to “know it all.” That’s where we come in.</p>

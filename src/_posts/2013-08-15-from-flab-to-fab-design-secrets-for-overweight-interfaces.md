We've all seen them: data-heavy websites and gnarly back-office apps that are so cramped and complex even the wireframes make your eyes water. Believe it or not, big can be beautiful!

Join us this month as Kim Bieler ([@feadog](https://twitter.com/feadog)), UX manager at Mandiant, shows us how a handful of simple design principles can tame even the most dense and intimidating interfaces and make them understandable—even enjoyable—for users. Each principle is illustrated with step-by-step makeovers of real interfaces. You'll leave this talk understanding not only how to apply these techniques to new designs and existing products, but more importantly, WHY they work.

This month, we'll be at the [iStrategyLabs offices](https://www.google.com/maps?q=1630+Connecticut+Ave+NW,+Washington,+DC+20009&hl=en&sll=38.003385,-79.420925&sspn=10.494296,11.590576&hnear=1630+Connecticut+Ave+NW,+Washington,+District+of+Columbia+20009&t=m&z=17) at Connecticut Ave and Hillyer Place. Kim's presentation will kick off promptly at 7:00pm, but come early and enjoy some food and drinks provided by iStrategyLabs!

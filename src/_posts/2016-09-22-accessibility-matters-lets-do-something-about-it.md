Making your work accessible creates a better experience across the board. As creators, it is our responsibility to make sure that everyone–regardless of ability, situation, or context–can access it.

At [Vox Media](http://www.voxmedia.com/pages/about-vox-media), quick growth and fast deadlines never allowed accessibility to be a forethought. We have many advocates for accessibility throughout the company, but originally, we didn't have a company-wide structure in place to implement standards across the board. Earlier this year we decided to change that. Six team members gathered for two days to figure out just how to approach accessibility on a company-wide scale. Over the course of two days, we documented role-specific best practices and how each team member could implement them into their actual work. Later, we shared what we learned with the company and open sourced a checklist for anyone to use.

This talk will dive into accessibility best-practices, why it is important, and how we're making a cultural shift to focus on it at Vox Media.

[Ally Palanzi](http://allypalanzi.com) is a front-end engineer with a passion for design, accessibility, and ice cream. Currently, she works at Vox Media building scalable systems for 8 brands and over 300 websites.

Wayan Vota, of [One Laptop Per Child News](http://www.olpcnews.com/), will be leading a discussion on the impact of OLPC on web design, the “average user experience,” content generation, and consumption itself in the developing world. With 5-10 million laptops set to be distributed in the next 12-18 months (the single largest computer monoculture ever shipped), children in the developing world will be consuming and producing educational content on a grand scale.

Join us for what should be a fantastic discussion. Come early (~6:30pm) for food and drink, meeting starts at 7:00pm sharp!

The Motley Fool’s offices are located on Duke Street just across from the King Street Metro station on the Yellow/Blue lines (take the tunnel!).

Long gone are the days when product designers were simply just designing. Today designers are ideating, planning, testing, generating buy-in and much more. In this talk Ramla Mahmood will go over what it means to be a product designer today and how to be a valuable resource in any company. She will go specifically into designing for various tools and features and discuss how to effectively have impact at every step.

Ramla Mahmood ([@ramoved](https://twitter.com/ramoved)) is product designer based in the Washington D.C area. She is currently at [15Five](https://www.15five.com) working in the space of HR tech and creating healthier workplace engagement. Previously she was at [Vox Media](https://www.voxmedia.com) designing publishing tools on [Chorus](https://getchorus.voxmedia.com). She focuses her external work on initiatives that focus on community, education, and accountability in tech. She has taught courses for [Girl Develop It](https://www.girldevelopit.com) and has led workshops with various youth organizations in the area.

Our friends at [Compass](https://www.compass.com) will be hosting this month's event. Doors open at 6:30 PM.

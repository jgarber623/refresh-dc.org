Over the past years, web and mobile designers started to use animation more and more often not just to delight, but also to tell the story and to drive user experience. UI animation is a combination of the how with the when and why — the proper techniques of applying motion to UI and captivating an audience, combined with the most integral moments in user experience where you can start engaging your users in a two-way dialogue.

Join us this month, as Kit Oliynyk, Creative Director at Capital One looks to empower designers and front-end developers to create UI animations in a functional, material and delightful way.

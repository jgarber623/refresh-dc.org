A deep-dive into the process behind alternative movie posters and how Tracie Ching's "Thor: Ragnarok" went from an idea to a nationally distributed print. In this talk Tracie will discuss:

- Getting into licensed movie posters
- Approval process and timeline for licensed properties
- Her creation process
- And other trade secrets...

Living and working in Washington, DC, [Tracie Ching](http://www.tracieching.com) is a self-taught digital artist specializing in complex, graphic portraiture. Her work often involves a limited palette—a tendency-turned-style after years of working in the medium of silkscreen prints. While commissioned for a wide range of projects including commercial athletic apparel, editorial illustration, and gallery work, Tracie Ching is best known for her alternative movie posters.

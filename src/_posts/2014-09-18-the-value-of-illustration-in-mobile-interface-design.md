The most recent trend toward a flatter UI design has made apparent how valuable the skills an illustrator can bring to bear on interface work. Though obviously helpful everywhere, the impact on mobile design can be felt more clearly. Clean design on mobile interfaces is essential but what gets ignored in the appreciation of the work is that some of that UI is carefully drawn by illustrators. From operating system iconography to weather data visualization and more, illustration plays a heavy role in defining data immediately for the customer with concise and immediately understood illustrated visuals.

[Margaret Haag](https://twitter.com/mhstudios) joined the [Gannett Digital](https://twitter.com/gannettdigital) product design team over a year ago after working predominantly in print design. Her top notch illustrator skills and clean aesthetic won her a spot on the mobile design team where she evangelizes the strengths of Illustration in mobile UI.

This month, we'll be meeting at [LMO Advertising](http://www.lmo.com), just a short walk from either the [Rosslyn](https://www.wmata.com/rider-guide/stations/rosslyn.cfm) and [Court House](https://www.wmata.com/rider-guide/stations/court-house.cfm) Metro stops on the Orange and Silver Lines. LMO has also generously offered to sponsor food and drinks for everyone, so come out early to grab a bite and a drink and get settled in!

Do you see yourself as a design leader? Let's talk about it. Better yet, let's co-create new possibilities together and envision your future as a design leader with a group of other passionate designers. Take-aways from this interactive workshop include: energy, intentionality, and clear action steps for moving forward. (OK, there will be paper too…)

## About the Speaker

Hi, I'm [Dr. Jo Golden](https://twitter.com/jogolden) I co-lead the all-volunteer [OpenIDEO DC](https://www.meetup.com/OpenIDEO-DC) Chapter where we teach Human-Centered Design in the community, conduct research, and use Design Thinking to solve local problems. I also teach Design Leadership at the Maryland Institute College of Art and work as a Service Design Lead at [Fjord](https://www.fjordnet.com) in Accenture's DC Digital Design Studio solving wicked problems for the Government.

## Getting to ISL

[ISL](https://isl.co) is located at 641 S St. NW in the historic Shaw neighborhood of Washington, DC. The closest Metro station is Shaw–Howard University on the green and yellow lines.

We'll kick things off promptly at 7:00 PM, but come by a bit early and enjoy food and drinks provided by our wonderful hosts!

You've probably heard of the popular front-end frameworks React and Vue.js by now. Both are open source JavaScript frameworks for building user interfaces and single-page applications.

This month, we'll be exploring how these frameworks are similar and how they differ. We'll look at creating components, applications, learning curves and plenty more.

## Our Speakers

- Chip Cullen, Director of Technology at PBS
- Benjamin Hong, Senior Front-end Engineer at GitLab
- Josh Goldman, Software Engineer at Medallia

Our friends at Threespot will be hosting this month's event and providing refreshments beforehand. Doors open at 6:30 PM.

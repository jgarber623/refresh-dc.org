The presentation will focus on getting your feet wet with jQuery, the fast and easy-to-use JavaScript library, and will cover things you should know, selecting, caching, and traversing. The talk will be intermediate-level technically, but newcomers are encouraged to come, participate, and learn as well. All questions will be answered.

Benjamin Sterling is a Sr. Web Developer with Information Experts, a company that provides Web Based Training to Commercial and Government agencies in the DC/VA area. He is well-versed in a number of programming languages but focused primarily on jQuery, WordPress, CodeIgniter, and ColdFusion. In his spare time, he works with the web community in the Baltimore/Washington DC area coordinating and organizing informational presentation, networking events and helping were needed, among other things.

We'll be meeting in Studio C at CDIA, which is across the hall from the room we normally meet in.

# Code of Conduct

Refresh DC is an inclusive community based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof). As a participant at one of our events, you agree to be nice, considerate, and civil toward other participants. Do not be mean or nasty. Pretty easy, right?

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the organizers immediately. Refresh DC is currently organized by [Jason Garber](https://twitter.com/jgarber), [Audrey Matthias](https://twitter.com/aimatthias), [Rochelle Pennington](https://twitter.com/rochellfp), and [Nick Whitmoyer](https://twitter.com/whistle).

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior must immediately comply. If a participant engages in any of the aforementioned behavior, we may take any action we deem appropriate, from warning the offender to immediately expelling the offender from the venue. Participants engaging in the aforementioned behavior may also be barred from attending future Refresh DC events.

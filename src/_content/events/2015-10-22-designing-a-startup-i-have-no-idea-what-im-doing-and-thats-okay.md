Perhaps you've been presented with an opportunity that scared you. Challenged you. Pushed you. That's been Laura's experience since joining TrackMaven almost 3 years ago. Now leading a team of 5 on the Design team, she'll talk about the importance of pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone, taking on responsibilities you've never had before (like hiring, managing and leading a team) and how to keep growing when your job changes every 6 months. This talk should provide value and insight to anyone feeling stuck, feeling overwhelmed, or just plain curious of what happens when you join a rocket-ship of a startup as the first designer.

Beyond getting out of the building and talking to users, some of the most valuable insights you can gather come from putting a prototype in a user's hand and learning more about how they use it over time. In this conversation, we'll cover:

- How to sell the idea of beta testing to your manager or your client
- How to integrate qualitative and quantitative UX research into the design and development lifecycle
- Best practices for working effectively with client success/account management (for B2B) or user support (for B2C)
- How to draw valuable user insights from beta testing feedback

In some ways, performance is similar to butter; you don't really notice it until it's gone and by then it's too late. Instead of running out of butter, learn the essential techniques to measure and benchmark front-end performance and make butter happen! First, we'll start with examining [Google's RAIL performance model](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/profile/evaluate-performance/rail) to uncover the measurable areas where users experience "slowness". Then, we'll discover ways to gather performance data for each and set performance budgets around them. Finally, we'll see real world examples (gotta get in the code!) for optimizing different performance challenges.

[Andrew Krawchyk](https://twitter.com/krawchyk) is a Senior Web Developer at [ISL](https://isl.co) working primarily with JavaScript but dabbles in Python too. By night, he teaches front-end web development classes at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly), and sometimes hangs out at their [JS Guild](https://generalassemb.ly/education/javascript-guild). His favorite projects are front-end "microsites" and helpful Internet of Things interfaces. In his free time, he likes contributing to various open source projects, including Mozilla Firefox.

## Getting to CHIEF

[CHIEF](http://agencychief.com) is located at 1800 Massachusetts Ave. NW (2nd Floor) in Dupont Circle, just around the corner from the Dupont Circle station on Metro's Red line. We'll kick things off promptly at 7pm, but come by a bit early to get settled and enjoy food and drinks provided by our generous hosts!

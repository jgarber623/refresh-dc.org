As the web has gotten faster, websites have gotten more demanding. And yet, users have gotten only more impatient. Site speed / performance is just as big of an issue as it was 10 years ago and is still one of the most critical metrics to keep users happy and engaged. Join us as Antoinette shares with us strategies to help developers and designers build lean sites while retaining great visual design and usability.

## Antoinette Janus

NoVA native, Antoinette Janus comes to us with a cross functional background in design and development with a passion for pushing the boundaries of the web while keeping web standards in mind. She's currently an engineer at PBS kids where she brings her sharp tech mind together with her design background from FSU. Outside of work, she has a love for generative art ([https://codepen.io/internette/](https://codepen.io/internette/)) and organizes the DC codepen meetup.

## About Our Host, Optoro

What started out as a ship-to-ebay store front in Georgetown has turned into a multimillion dollar B2B enterprise that helps national retailers manage their return stock and excess inventory. Listed in Forbes' 2017 "next billion dollar startups," Optoro is one of DC's fastest growing tech companies.

## Getting to Optoro

Optoro is located on the 12th floor of [1001 G Street NW, Washington, DC](https://goo.gl/maps/DVe3fYYwNS32). They're closest to the 11th Street exit from Metro Center.

The talk starts at 7:00 pm, but doors open at 6:30, so come early and get to know your fellow Refresh DC members!

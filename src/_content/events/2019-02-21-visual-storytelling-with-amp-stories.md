An extension of the Accelerated Mobile Pages Project (AMP), AMP stories enable mobile-optimized, tap-through stories like you find on Instagram and SnapChatâ€”but for the web. The Washington Post news design team has been producing AMP Stories since the launch of the format in early 2018.

## Our Speakers

- [Joanne Lee](https://twitter.com/joannejoolee), Designer and Art Director at The Washington Post
- [Matthew Callahan](https://twitter.com/mg_callahan), Design Editor at The Washington Post
- [Nick Kirkpatrick](https://twitter.com/n_kirkpatrick), Photo Editor at The Washington Post

In this talk, our speakers will introduce you to building AMP Stories. They'll review the user experience and tech specs (and how they've extended it to meet their needs). They'll show how the format ties into The Washington Post's visual storytelling strategy and how you can use it for your own narratives. They'll also share findings from usability labs and the limitations of the current framework to help you make informed decisions about whether or not to start building your own AMP Stories.

Doors open at 6:30 PM and the presentation will begin promptly at 7 PM. Drinks and snacks will be provided.

We've all done it before: thrown in some dummy text into a design, figuring we'll worry about what will actually go there later. Teams expect us to move fast, and we deliver; after all, copy doesn't take too long to update.

But when content is an afterthought like this, a lot can go wrong. Designs tend to break after they've shipped, resulting in a lot of wasted time and money—not to mention extra work for everyone involved. But content isn't always available at the start. So what's a designer to do?

In this talk, we'll go over:

- Stories and examples of why designing with a content-first mindset is so crucial
- Practical alternatives to using “lorem ipsum” (no writing background required!)
- How to convince clients/stakeholders of the value of UX writing and content strategy

Our friends at [Compass](https://www.compass.com) will be hosting this month's event. Doors open at 6:30 PM. Refreshments will be provided by TEKsystems.

## About Vidhika

Vidhika Bansal ([@vidhster](https://twitter.com/vidhster)) firmly believes design should be about people first and technology second. Over the last decade, she has helped shape product and design strategies for clients such as Hilton, 23andMe, Gap Inc., Facebook, PwC, NASDAQ, and C-SPAN. Now, she aligns cross-functional teams at CARFAX to build B2B and B2C solutions that meet both business goals and people's real, often unarticulated needs.

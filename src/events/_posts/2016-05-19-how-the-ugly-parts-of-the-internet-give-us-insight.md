Lessons from a Digital Dumpster Dive: Understanding How the Ugliest Parts of the Internet Can Offer Insight Into Our Future

There's a lot on the internet that makes us wince (YouTube comments), but it's part of a larger phenomena that if properly understood, can help us become better product designers and digital marketers.

Join us this month as Matt Camp a UX Developer from Maga Design discusses the parallels between Media Theory and User Experience Design.

## Getting to CHIEF

[CHIEF](http://agencychief.com) is located at 1800 Massachusetts Ave. NW (2nd Floor) in Dupont Circle, just around the corner from the Dupont Circle station on Metro's Red line. We'll kick things off promptly at 7pm, but come by a bit early to get settled and enjoy food and drinks provided by our generous hosts!

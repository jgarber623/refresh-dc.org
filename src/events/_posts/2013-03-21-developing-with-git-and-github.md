In the fast-paced world of web development, it's more important than ever to manage your code and be able to share it with individuals and teams. Version control is a crucial part of the development workflow, and chances are, you'll eventually work on a team that requires some knowledge of Git. Additionally, GitHub has emerged as one of the most popular places to store code and collaborate on everything from open-source software to that cool experiment you've been working on late at night.

This month, GitHub's Matt Yoho will discuss the fundamentals of using Git and GitHub to collaborate, and how to integrate these tools into your design and development process.

**About the speaker:**

Matt Yoho is a Ruby and Javascript-loving web developer, freelance karaoke operative, and comic book guy. He spends his time building tools to make GitHub's Supportocats lives warmer and fuzzier.

What is a "visualization" for someone who can't see? How do you take something inherently visual—a rich, highly interactive data visualization—and make it usable for people across the spectrum of visual impairment, from color deficiency to blindness? How can we evolve our design and development approach to create solutions that work for everyone?

Senior Designer, [Nguyet Vuong](http://newwaydesign.com) and Web Developer, [Tommy O'Keefe](https://twitter.com/tommyokeefe) from [Atlantic Media Strategies](http://atlanticmediastrategies.com) team up to discuss what it means to design and develop for an inclusive audience in an agency setting and how no-screen-first is their evolving approach to integrating accessibility into their workflow. They'll explore strategies and discuss learnings for creating accessible experiences that are inclusive and future-friendly.

## Getting to ISL

ISL is located at 641 S St. NW (1st Floor) in DC's historic Shaw neighborhood, just around the corner from the Shaw-Howard station on Metro's Green and Yellow lines. We'll kick things off promptly at 7pm but come by a little early to get settled!

Oooh, That's Clever! (Unnatural Experiments in Web Design)
Find inspiration in the ridiculous. See technological quirks as opportunities. Try something previously unheard of with your site design. Laugh in the face of convention. Use and abuse CSS in ways never before imagined. Get away with it. And if it doesn't work, try something else instead.

All the way from the UK, Paul Annett is Clearleft's visual design lead. At this year's SXSW he entertained the crowd with a magic trick and a live-action stage-show of a website, in this presentation which changed the way people design sites. He has worked as a freelance web designer, a TV production assistant, and a magician. These things taught him the art of smoke and mirrors. So far no-one has rumbled him.

Join us at CDIA for another great Refresh DC on a strange Tuesday night timeslot. This is the chance for all you "I'm always busy on Thursdays" people to make it out, no excuses.

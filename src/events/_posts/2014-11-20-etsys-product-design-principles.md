Behind the scenes, [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com) is a company obsessed with moving fast and breaking things. But how do you balance a culture of continuous deployment with a quality-obsessed design team? This talk will encompass Etsy's product design principles, illustrated with a variety of stories from inside the company. Peer into teeny-tiny feature design, successful (and unsuccessful) launches and how Etsy tackles design problems every day.

[Cap Watkins](http://capwatkins.com) is a Sr. Design Manager at Etsy. He's previously worked on hush-hush stuff at Amazon and led design for a number of startups, including Formspring and Zoosk. You can find him as [@cap](https://twitter.com/cap) on Twitter.

**UPDATE: OUR LOCATION HAS CHANGED**

This month, we'll be meeting at [Canvas](http://canvas.co/work) (located at 19th & M), just a short walk from either Farragut West & North, and Dupont Circle Metro stops on the Red, Blue, Orange and Silver lines. [AddThis](http://www.addthis.com) has generously offered to sponsor food and drinks for everyone, so come out early to grab a bite and a drink and get settled in!

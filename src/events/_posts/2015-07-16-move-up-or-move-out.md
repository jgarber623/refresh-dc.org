_**Building a successful career in a creative agency without managing people**_

Why is it that brilliant designers and copywriters are often terrible managers? You may be working for (or with) one right now. Or, worse, you may be one yourself. If left unchecked, this scenario can be detrimental to your team, the quality of your work, and, as a result, to the success of your organization. Unfortunately, senior creatives have little choice for career growth—other than to become managers—in most creative agencies or in-house creative services departments, whether or not they are prepared to do so. What can we do to change this? [Katerina Martchouk](https://twitter.com/bukvaK) will lead a discussion of ideas that could make our work environment more supportive and creative careers more rewarding.

For over 15 years, Katerina has worked at a number of national and global creative agencies as a copywriter, Associate Creative Director and Creative Director. Since moving to DC recently and working as a consultant, Katerina has had a chance to step back from the everyday mayhem of the agency world, reflect on the career development weaknesses inherent in the creative industry, and evaluate opportunities that could benefit all creative professionals.

[Atlantic Media Strategies](http://atlanticmediastrategies.com) has offered to host this month's meeting. Join us Thursday evening at the Watergate Office Building just a short walk from the Foggy Bottom Metro stop. Parking is available from the F Street entrance. We'll kick things off promptly at 7:00pm, but come out early to socialize and grab a bit to eat!

These days we’re all writers. Whether we’re communicating with clients or peers, putting spoken language into written form plays a significant role in our daily lives; most of us wouldn’t mind getting better at it, or at least would like to avoid looking dumb doing it. Problem is, how do we know if what we write is “right”? To find out, we’ll take a look at how the rules of written English got so strange in the first place, and talk about ways to become more confident in your writing (digital and otherwise) and have more fun at the task.

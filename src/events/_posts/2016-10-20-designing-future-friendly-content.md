Are you ready for the next disruption? Whatever your role in creating digital spaces, you need to be ready for what’s around the corner. Organizations whose primary asset is content and information need to rethink how they organize and structure it so it can be reused, remixed, and restyled on any device and at any scale. Interfaces are windows on a structured world beneath. Designing Future-Friendly Content explores the benefits of planning content outside of an interface and leads you and your team through a process to make sure you are ready for what’s next.

Ship and iterate products faster. Make content management more efficient. Improve user journeys. Allow for easier iteration of interface design and future growth without compromising structure. Provide the context that makes content easier to find and understand, both for people and for machines. Then build a content model that informs the implementation of your CMS.

This process works especially well for people experienced with large, subject-based content inventories and has been used successfully by professional associations, media companies, and government agencies. Designers, developers, project managers, content strategists will all gain insight into a new way to think about content and the design process.

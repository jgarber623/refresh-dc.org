_"If you build it, they will come."_

Famous and true words for baseball, sure—but what about for digital tools and platforms? Is it enough to build the next mobile app or the latest online portal and just hope that people will use it?

How do you build a community of evangelists when you can't pay them for their contributions? How do you make room for new collaborators to inform what you ultimately create? How do you ensure that you're creating space and opportunity for people to give feedback and inform future iterations of what you're building?

In her talk, Ashley will lay out her favorite tips for designing with users, not for them. She'll also share some of the human-centered design questions she's currently exploring with her teammates at vizzuality and offer examples of how vizzuality approaches data visualization with users in mind.

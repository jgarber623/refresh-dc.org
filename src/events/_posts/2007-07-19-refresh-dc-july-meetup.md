[Jeremy Carbaugh](http://carbauja.com/), web developer with the [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/), will show how current web technologies are being used to get citizens involved in government and hold Congress more accountable to their constituents.

The Motley Fool's offices are located on Duke Street just across from the King Street Metro station on the Yellow/Blue lines (take the tunnel!).

## We're celebrating our 100th event this month!

As we say thanks to everyone who's helped make it possible, we've got a few special things lined up for you. We'll be starting off with Refresh DC's founder [Jason Garber](https://twitter.com/jgarber), followed by a presentation by [Ross Nover](https://twitter.com/rosscott) from Friendly Design Co., and wrap up with an after party that includes a sponsored bar tab.

Join us Thursday evening, September 17th at the [CHIEF](http://www.agencychief.com/) offices just a short walk from the Dupont Circle Metro stop. We'll kick things off promptly at 7:00pm, but come out early to socialize and grab tacos and drinks!

Afterwards we'll head to [The Embassy Row Hotel](https://www.destinationhotels.com/embassy-row-hotel) rooftop bar for a the after party.

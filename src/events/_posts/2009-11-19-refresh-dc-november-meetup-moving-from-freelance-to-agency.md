This month, in a very special NoVA edition of Refresh DC, we'll host a panel featuring the founders of some of the region's most well-known small- and mid-size web shops.

These founders will share their stories and talk about the highs and the lows as they moved from going it alone to having to deal with salaries, benefits, office space, and lots of clients.

Our panelists will include:

Anthony Pappas, President and Creative Director, Pappas Group
Brian Williams, CEO, Viget Labs
Jen Sterling, President, Hinge
Martin Ringlein, Senior Consultant, Nclud
Jeff Walpole, CEO, Phase2 Technology

Bring your questions, and they'll bring the wisdom.

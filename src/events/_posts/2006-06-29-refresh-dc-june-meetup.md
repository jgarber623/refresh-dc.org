This month, Jeremy Carbaugh and Jason Garber will be leading a discussion on APIs - what they are, what they mean to you, and why your next killer web app should have one.

The meeting will be held in the National Digital Library Learning Center on the first floor of the Library of Congress’ James Madison Memorial Building. As far as we can tell, the nearest metro stop is Capitol South on the orange/blue lines.

**Update:** Fred put together a [good area map](http://refresh-dc.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=32#p119) if you’re coming by metro.

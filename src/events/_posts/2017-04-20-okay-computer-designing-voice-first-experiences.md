Amazon's Echo voice assistant was its best selling product this holiday season and hands-free, voice-first interactions for the home (and car) are exploding. You make sites and apps—should you have a voice experience as well?

Over the last year, [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com) launched four apps bringing our journalism to Amazon Alexa and Google Home platforms. Learn from our experience on…

- what integrations are possible on each platform,
- what kinds of experiences work best on voice-first platforms,
- how to design and test voice user interfaces (VUI's), and
- how to build data services that support rich content across multiple surfaces.

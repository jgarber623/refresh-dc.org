D3.js is an exceptionally fast, powerful, and flexible library for creating web standards based visualizations. It is the standard for doing visualization on the web. Yet, whenever you discuss learning D3, phrases like "mind bending" and "extremely steep learning curve" come up. How can you leverage D3 without getting fed up?

[Seth Blanchard](https://twitter.com/SethBlanchard) will provide a brief overview of D3 and its capabilities before diving into a discussion on strategies for deepening your understanding of this excellent library.

Seth is a full stack web developer with a passion for data visualization. Over the past 10 years, he has built everything from unexploded ordinance discrimination software to interactive network visualizations for a government agency. When not chasing his two children, he spends his time visualizing sports analytics.

This month, we'll be meeting at [LMO Advertising](http://www.lmo.com/), just a short walk from either the [Rosslyn](http://wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=41) and [Court House](http://wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=96) Metro stops on the Orange and Silver Lines. LMO has also generously offered to sponsor food and drinks for everyone, so come out early to grab a bite and a drink and get settled in!

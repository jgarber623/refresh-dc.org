Companies spend enormous amounts of time and money designing the experience for products and services. But in truth, “the” user experience isn’t a singular experience at all. And it doesn’t happen on any screen – it happens in the mind. More specifically, the six minds. John Whalen will describe how to uncover the conscious and subconscious needs of your users using qualitative research techniques, and how to integrate what you’ve discovered into your products and service designs. No psychology PhD required!

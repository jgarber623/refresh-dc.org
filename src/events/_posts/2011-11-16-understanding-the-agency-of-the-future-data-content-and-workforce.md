For our last talk in 2011, weâ€™re excited to have local superstar [Leslie Bradshaw](http://blogs.forbes.com/lesliebradshaw/), President, COO & Cofounder of [JESS3](http://jess3.com/), presenting. While managing offices and team members from LA to Orlando and DC to Australia, Leslie has been named one of the top five female executives in the tech industry by Fast Company for her role in implementing corporate social strategies for top brands like Intel, Nike, C-SPAN and Google. Join us on Wednesday, November 16th at the AARP offices as she paints a vivid picture of what the agency of the future will look like by covering information design, content strategy, and day to day operations.

The meeting starts at 7pm, but feel free to come out a little early to grab some food and socialize. We'll be heading out for the usual drinks and catching up afterwards, so stick around.

When you ask users to take action—from logging in, to clicking on a link, to exercising more—the application or website must pass five mental tests in a blink of an eye. If it fails any one of them, the user will get distracted or discouraged and you’ll lose them.

[HelloWallet](http://www.hellowallet.com/)'s Principal Scientist Steve Wendel will give you practical guidelines for designing intentional action into a product, building on research in behavioral economics and psychology and the practical experiences of HelloWallet.

**You already know how to make your products beautiful, engaging, and usable.** This talk is about making them effective at supporting users to take action.

This month, we return to [nclud](http://nclud.com)'s offices on K St. Steve's presentation will kick off promptly at 7:00pm, but come early and enjoy some food and drinks generously sponsored by the fine folks at [AddThis](http://www.addthis.com/)!

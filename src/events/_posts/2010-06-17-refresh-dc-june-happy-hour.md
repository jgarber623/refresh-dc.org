This month’s we’ll be joining up for a happy hour at BlackFinn DC. The BlackFinn staff is offering a couple complimentary rounds of light appetizers . Drink specials until 9pm are $3 Miller Drafts, $4 Amstel Drafts, and $5 house wines. We’ll have plenty of tables reserved for our group, just ask about Refresh DC when you get in.

Closest Metro stops are McPherson Square or Farragut West on the Orange Line.

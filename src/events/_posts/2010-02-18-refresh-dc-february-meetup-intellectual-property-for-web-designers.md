Now that we are all done digging ourselves out of the snow (hopefully), get ready to join back up with fellow Refreshers this month at the Motley Fool. This Thursday, Barbara I. Berschler will discuss the basics of intellectual property and contracting issues as they pertain to web designers. Whether you are a freelancer just starting, or already have successful business, knowing the ins and outs of copyright, trademarks, and contracting can be critical to the livelihood of your creative profession.

Barbara Berschler has practiced general business law in the Washington, DC metropolitan area since 1985. In 2003, she received an LLM degree from the Washington College of Law, where she concentrated on intellectual property course work. In addition to advising business clients about entity formation and operation, buying and selling of businesses, commercial lease negotiations, and contracts, she provides them with counsel about issues related to their use and protection of intellectual property. Barbara has lectured extensively and written about trademarks, copyright, licensing agreements for intellectual property. View Barbara's website at www.berschlerlaw.com

Barbara will give an overview of the different kinds of intellectual property web designers are likely to encounter. She will discuss ownership issues related to the content in websites, some contract provisions the designer may wish to include in his/her agreements, and issues related to licensing of software.

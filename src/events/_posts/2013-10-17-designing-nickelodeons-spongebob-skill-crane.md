People are bored with social media, but the connection of online and offline experiences are increasingly compelling. We'll explore how iStrategyLabs's design team built an internet connected skill crane for Nickelodeon to excite its 44 million SpongeBob Square pant's Facebook fans, and how 3D printing, physical prototyping and hand drawn illustration combine to produce a unique experience.

ISL designers [Mike O'Brien](https://twitter.com/redtablepress) and [Maggie Winters](https://twitter.com/moonstompmaggie) will take you step by step through this wacky world of hacking SpongeBob. A full recap of this project can be found [here](http://stories.istrategylabs.com/nick).

The more we know about website accessibility, the better it is for everyone. Accessible websites:

- **Improve search engine results.** Search engines read the source code (like screen readers do), and clean code improves your ranking.
- **Reduce maintenance costs.** The cleaner the code, the easier it is to maintain the site and make future updates.
- **Increase profits.** If your costs go down and if more people can use your site to make purchases, your profits have to go up.

Today people get their information by using desktops (with one or more monitors), laptops, netbooks, tablets, smartphones, e-readers, and more. No matter what device they use, they all have one thing in common: they want to find the information they are looking for. By creating websites that are accessible, we make it easier for people to find that information.

This session will be run by John F. Croston III, who is a web developer and accessibility advocate from the Washington, DC area. John is the Web Accessibility Manager for the United States Department of Labor Office of Public Affairs and is well known for his work in organizing Accessibility Camp DC, as well as participating many other DC Tech Events.

This presentation will be a 60-minute lecture introducing several techniques that you can take advantage of to build an accessible website using a variety of ideas and code samples. During this session, John will provide some easy-to-remember ways that you can use to improve the accessibility of your website, but that won’t take a lot of effort on your part.

Drawing from his 18+ years of experience of mainframe programming (COBOL) and seven years of web programming experience, John will cover the following areas to help you make your website more accessible:

- Do fonts and font sizes matter?
- How can color and contrast help increase the accessibility of your website?
- Should you still use layout tables in a web standards world?
- Should you validate your pages?
- Should you use semantic HTML?
- Is "skip" navigation helpful?
- Do color and contrast improve your website’s readability?
- Do you really need both hover and focus on your links?
- Are "click here" and "read more" links easy to understand? What about when someone reads them out of context?
- Are headings (h1, h2, h3, etc.) an easy way to navigate a website?
- What does it take to make an accessible form?
- Can ARIA landmark roles, like “banner”, improve a website’s accessibility?

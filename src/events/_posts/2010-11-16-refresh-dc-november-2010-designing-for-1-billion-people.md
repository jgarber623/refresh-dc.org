That’s right Refresh DC is BACK! We have a really fantastic set of upcoming speakers.

**What**

We’re really excited to kick it off this November with...

[Clearspring’s](http://clearspring.com/) Director of Product Management Jim Lane talking about his experiences with working on the [AddThis sharing platform](http://addthis.com/) and specifically, “Designing for 1 Billion People.”

Jim will be discussing how a small team grew AddThis into the largest sharing platform in the world, reaching over one billion people. Starting with a modest interface, the team has focused on reaching the widest possible audience by keeping design and branding simple, and putting users first. Because of the platform’s large scale, the team has been able to iteratively measure and test in order to direct design and development. In addition, the team has tackled interesting challenges in scaling the product and architecture to a multi-national audience, while maintaining an effective user-experience (and keeping our CFO happy.)

We hope you’ll take away some ideas for applying solutions like these to your own product or organization, whether you are designing for one hundred users, or a billion.

After Jim’s excellent talk, we’ll be headed to a TBA bar/pub/establishment where we will have raucous merriment.

**Where**

This month, we’re excited to be hosted by the Motley Fool in Alexandria. It’s across the street from the [King Street Metro Stop](http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=48) on the Blue and Yellow Line.

Please Note: The new address is 1925 Ballenger Avenue, 4th Floor, one block from the main office.

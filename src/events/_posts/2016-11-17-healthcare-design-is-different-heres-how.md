Healthcare in the United States is a complex system of interrelated services. Successfully designing for healthcare requires empathy for _everyone_ in the system, multi-disciplinary collaboration _within_ your team, and a data _first_ approach to design. Please join us for a short introduction to the problems that make healthcare design unique, and the (sometimes contradictory) processes that you can use to solve them.

[Benno Schmidt](https://twitter.com/abennoschmidt) is a healthcare designer in Washington, DC. He currently is a member of the [United States Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov), and works at the [Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov).

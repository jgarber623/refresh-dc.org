Color is such a fundamental part of the visual design process that articulating the development of a color palette can be overlooked. As a visual designer, David will talk about being mindful of the use of color. As someone who is colorblind, he will discuss how his condition has lead him to approach color theory in a unique way, resulting in applying the new HSLa color value. The talk will be part color theory, part accessibility, part technical demonstration.

David will be introducing himself as the new helmsman of the Refresh DC ship. He works as a web designer for nclud, where he explores the frontiers of front-end web development.

Please join us at CDIA in Georgetown for 2010's first Refresh DC meeting.

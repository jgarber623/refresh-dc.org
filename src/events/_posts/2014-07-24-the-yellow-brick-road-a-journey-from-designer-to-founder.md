As designers, we often dream of the day we give client work the boot and start a company of our own. But what does that path really entail? Entering startup land is like waking up in Oz but without the munckins. Grab your slippers and join us as [Tom Giannattasio](http://attasi.com/) discusses the peaks and valleys of the yellow brick road.

Tom has helped some of the world's leading organizations—including Apple, Oracle and MIT—design and develop bad ass, HTML-based products. A year ago, he left his day job to start a company called [Macaw](http://macaw.co/), where he leads a team building software for designers and developers.

We'll be gathering again this month at [nclud](http://nclud.com/)'s K St. NW offices. Tom's presentation will start promptly at 7:00pm, so come out early and grab a seat!

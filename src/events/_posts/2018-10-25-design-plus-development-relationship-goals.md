The relationship between design and development is one that should be harmonious and mutually beneficial. Yet, it can often be contentious and frustrating. Designers feel like they are being explicit with their requirements, yet the resulting product is rarely what they envisioned.

In this talk, you'll hear directly from a designer and developer about what is going through their mind during the product life cycle. They will not only focus on key pain points when working together, but will provide ways to address competing priorities and create a positive working relationship.

Doors open at 6:30 PM, and the presentation will begin promptly at 7 PM. Drinks will be provided.

### How to get there:

Metro: POLITICO is located a block away from the Rosslyn metro. When you arrive at the main entrance of the 1100 Wilson Blvd (the 1100 and 1000 buildings are connected), take the escalators to the next level and continue walking (you will pass several shops including a floral shop and the Great Eatery Cafe) until you reach the elevators.

Parking: If you plan to drive, there is parking available in the garage below our building. Pull into either parking entrance and chose any space that is not designated reserved. Take the elevator to the M level then make an immediate left out of the elevators and head left to the back set of elevators. Head up to 8th floor by clicking the "8th floor only" button.

There are also other garages around the building as well. And if you park in one of those, follow the directions in the Metro section above to find our offices.

This month, Refresh DC regular and Ironworks Art Director Corey Greeneltch will be presenting From Goya to Google: Traditional Design Principles at Work on the Web ... Or, "Everything I needed to know about Web Design I learned in Art History Class". I'll show how traditional art utilizes foundational design principles and discuss how we use these ancient techniques for success on the web.

We'll once again be at AARP, where food and beverage will be provided by the awesome folks at BOALT.

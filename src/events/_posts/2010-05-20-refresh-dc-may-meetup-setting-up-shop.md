The thought of self-employment or even freelancing on the side can seem overwhelming, especially when it comes to paying Uncle Sam and pleasing your clients, but it doesn't have to.

Nick Whitmoyer, senior consultant and founder of WHITMOYER ([http://whitmoyer.com/](http://whitmoyer.com/)), will discuss the ins and outs of setting up shop as a freelancer with tips for moonlighters and full-timers alike. You'll learn how to know when you're ready (or not) to venture out on your own, how to manage the many responsibilities involved with operating your own business, and how to produce creative work and happy clients - all while remaining profitable and expanding your portfolio.

Blockchain, a novel technology bristling with new concepts and arcane jargon, has triggered a land-rush of early adopters who are racing to understand and apply it. As the backbone of cryptocurrency, it weaves together data with cryptography in a unique way to verify a transaction; be it smart contracts, tokens or even code. With all the hype around it, how can designers leverage this technology to build products that people value?

This month, we will be digging into product design with blockchain and discussing how to think about designing products and services using this emerging technology.

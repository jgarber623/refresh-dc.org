**This month, Refresh DC turns five years old!**

To mark the occasion, we’ll be taking a look back at the history of Refresh both here in DC and around the country (and world!). We’ll also be looking ahead and setting a course for the foreseeable future.

We’ve got a few things planned, but the majority of this month’s meeting will be a group discussion. We encourage everyone to come prepared with ideas for how we can make Refresh DC better. General topics of discussion might include:

- What are some topics you’d be interested in learning about or presenting on?
- What’s the best method of notifying people of upcoming events?
- How can we better connect with the larger DC Tech community?

The fine folks at [AARP](http://www.aarp.org/) are hosting us again this month. They’ve played a big part in Refresh DC’s history over the last couple of years and we’re thankful that they’ve once again opened their doors to us.

We’re looking forward to seeing everyone on the 22nd!

Join us at the new [nclud](http://nclud.com) studio where some of the team will give you a behind-the-scenes look into how they created this year's [Beercamp](http://2013.beercamp.com) – a multiplayer action platformer game!

With a series of quick talks they'll share the process of going from concept art to production design, coding a real game environment for the browser, putting it all together, and why they ended up rolling their own server.

The speakers & their areas of concentration for the evening are:

- **John Salmon** , Senior Visual Designer – Gameplay Conception
- **Maxim Leyzerovich** , Senior UX Designer – UI & Game Design
- **Patrick Peak** , Chief Technology Officer – Technical Management
- **Mike Morris** , Javascript Developer Emeritus – Modern Front-end

nclud's studio is located on the 3rd floor at 1424 K St. NW. The meeting kicks off promptly at 7pm, but come out early to enjoy some food and drink provided by our hosts. They've even got DC Brau on tap!

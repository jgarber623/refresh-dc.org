In the age of digital overwhelm, there's a clear appetite for decluttering our physical space. Whether implementing the KonMari method or creating a capsule wardrobe, people are living with less. And yet, each day, companies are struggling with bloated websites, with content that is no longer relevant, necessary, or reflective of the organization. The typical solution—a comprehensive content audit, usually only done as part of a redesign—can overwhelm even the most organized digital team. Instead, these lessons from time-tested home organization methods can help you identify the most important content to invest in, making life easier both for your user and your organization.

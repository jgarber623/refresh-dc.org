By now, we're all familiar with some of the great data visualizations produced by the NYT, 538 and Washington Post. It's clear that data visualization is powerful but it seems like it's a medium limited to expert developers and data scientists.

But data-vis doesn't have to be intimidating. In fact, if you understand a few key principles, you can create compelling visualizations right away.

Join us next Thursday (Sept. 26) as Isabel Knight and Matt Camp host a talk + mini-workshop designed to equip you with the basic skills and mindset needed to help you become productive with data-vis on day 1.

In Data-Vis 101, you'll learn:

- How to choose the right chart for your data
- How to present data in a way your audience can understand
- Data-Vis dos and donâ€™ts
- Easy techniques to tell powerful stories with data
- How to sift through a simple data set to discover insights (workshop)

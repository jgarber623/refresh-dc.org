**Registration is now open. Grab a ticket**

Join us for an in-depth look at how USA TODAY transformed their digital content into a cohesive suite of products for modern consumers. We'll discuss how we've coupled the design for our browser and mobile products, then dive into the trenches of constructing the new [usatoday.com](http://usatoday.com). You will hear about our design philosophy, as well as a little detail about challenges we face in dealing with a (minimally) responsive application. You'll also learn about the frameworks we used, and what we've had to do to bridge the feature gaps between them.

Your fearless speakers:

**Andres Quesada** is the _Creative Director for Gannett Digital/USA TODAY_, where recently he’s played an active part of the redesign of the new [usatoday.com](http://usatoday.com). He has worked closely with colleagues from many disciplines to drive innovative, user-centered design principles to the web and mobile products for both USA TODAY and Gannett properties. His approach to design is focused on simplified, clean application interfaces that drive user engagement. Before Gannett, Andres spent the last 15 years working at start-ups in Northern Virginia, including AOL where he focused on both mobile and web application design and front-end development.

**Eamonn Bourke** is a _Sr. Mobile Designer with USA TODAY_. For the past 12 years he has been designing web and mobile experiences for a variety of organizations and brands (The U.S. Army, American Psychiatric Association, AARP International, George Mason University, Georgetown University, and USA TODAY). Eamonn is currently working on mobile app projects at USA TODAY; while moonlighting as an Adjunct Professor at George Mason University teaching User Experience Design at undergraduate and graduate levels, within their Graphic Design program.

**Erik Kallevig** is a _Sr. Mgr of UX Development for Gannett Digital_. He is responsible for various front-end web development projects across the Gannett platform. He began his work on the new [usatoday.com](http://usatoday.com) while working for Fantasy Interactive (Fi), the agency that led the redesign effort. Before joining Gannett, Erik worked at Fi New York on a variety of Google projects including 20 Things I Learned About Browsers and the Web, A Google a Day, and Google Zeitgeist among others.

**Jay Merrifield** is a _Senior UX Developer for Gannett Digital_ who has 10 years of experience building enterprise level interactive websites, including building the CMS that runs Fox New's mobile website, and building a geo exploitation web application for the military. At Gannett he spends most of his days focusing on the glue that holds the web application together, managing the comings and goings of resources and making certain the user doesn't accidentally go spinning off into the sun, or a black hole never to be heard from again.

_**We're meeting this month at [Capital One Labs](https://capitalonelabs.com/) in Clarendon. The meeting kicks off promptly at 7pm, but come by early for food and drinks sponsored by our gracious hosts!**_

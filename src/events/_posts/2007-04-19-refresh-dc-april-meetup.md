John Sutton, a Senior Information Architect (IA) and Interaction Designer (IxD) at [NavigationArts](http://www.navigationarts.com/), will be presenting an overview of Information Architecture and Interaction Design practices, and he will introduce some concepts that are in play today within the conversation circles of the practice.

Join us for what should be a fantastic discussion. Come early (~6:45pm) for food and drink, meeting starts at 7:00pm sharp!

The Motley Fool's offices are located on Duke Street just across from the King Street Metro station on the Yellow/Blue lines (take the tunnel!).

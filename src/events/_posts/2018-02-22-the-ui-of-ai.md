"AI" (or machine learning) has already begun to revolutionize our everyday interfaces: not in just how we consume productsâ€”but also how we design them. This talk will cover practical applications of AI in the design process, feature interactive demos of AI user experiences, and discuss the human-centered questions raised by the speculative near-futures of AI advancement.

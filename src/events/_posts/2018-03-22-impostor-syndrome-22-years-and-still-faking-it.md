Join us on Thursday, March 22nd, for a chance to meet [Robbie Holmes](https://twitter.com/robbiethegeek), Digital Service Expert for the U.S. Digital Service. Robbie wants to talk candidly about his experience with impostor syndrome, and the ways that companies and coworkers sometimes compounded and made it worse. You'll also hear about some methods and practices that he has been able to employ to _mostly_ combat his impostor syndrome over the last 20+ years.

Doors open at 6:30 PM so you can get here early and socialize with fellow Refresh members!

He wouldn't be where he was without the many open source communities he has been a part of as either a member or a community organizer.

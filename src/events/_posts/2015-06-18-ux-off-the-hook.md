As designers and developers, many of us understand the cues that keep users coming back for more. Every day we create interactions filled with hooksâ€”psychological triggers designed to compel users to check back in frequently. By repeatedly embracing these techniques, however, we implicitly assume that the mental tug of our product is more important than a user's physical environment at any given moment.

In this talk we'll consider different hook models, weighing the moral implications of these choices and what it means to find a sensible balance between user respect and product engagement. We'll explore strategies for creating mindful and responsible interactions and discuss what can be done to help avoid the misuse of our users.

[Mariesa Dale](https://twitter.com/mariesakdale) is a user experience designer, user interface developer and recovering Seattlite lost for ten years in the nation's capital. Previously dividing her time between The World Bank and her own clients, she recently traded it all in to become lead UX & UI developer for ArmorText, which is awesome. She also hates talking about herself in the third-person.

[Atlantic Media Strategies](http://atlanticmediastrategies.com/) has offered to host this month's meeting. Join us Thursday evening, June 16th at the Watergate Office Building just a short walk from the Foggy Bottom Metro stop. Parking is available from the F Street entrance. We'll kick things off promptly at 7:00pm, but come out early to socialize and grab a bit to eat!

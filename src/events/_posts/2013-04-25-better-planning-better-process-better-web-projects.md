Creative services and client relations can be tricky stuff! To make things trickier, we combine ever-changing processes and techniques to build websites.

This month, [Zach Goodwin](http://istrategylabs.com/team/zach-goodwin/), Creative Director at iStrategyLabs, details the techniques iSL employs to bring order and rigor to the creative process â€” with a focus on complicated web builds. Special attention will be paid to pre-project Discovery, and the best ways to extract meaningful, actionable information from clients. Tips and tricks for collaborating with clients, managing expectations, and presenting work to be featured.

We're meeting this month at iStrategyLabs in Dupont Circle. The meeting kicks off promptly at 7pm, but come by early for food and drinks sponsored by our gracious hosts!

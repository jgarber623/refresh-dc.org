Spring has sprung and we're back with another great presentation that will appeal equally to front-end developers, designers, and UX'ers!

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) has all the features that help us efficiently build powerful HTML prototypes. [Tony Pitale](http://tpitale.com) will show you how to leverage templates, layouts, includes, data, and GitHub pages to make your prototypes more flexible, maintainable, and effective.

This month, we'll be meeting again at [Opower](http://opower.com)'s office in Arlington, just steps away from the Courthouse Metro Station on the Orange Line. The meeting starts promptly at 7pm, but show up early to enjoy some food and drinks sponsored by [LivingSocial](https://www.livingsocial.com)!

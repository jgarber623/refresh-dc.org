We'll be kicking off the new year with a panel discussion about web application frameworks. The three frameworks on the chopping block are [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com), [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org), and [Zend](http://www.zend.com/en). Don't worry, though, we'll be keeping the discussion lively and topical to front end web developers and designers.

The goal isn't to tell you which framework is the best (Ruby on Rails, right?), but to illustrate the pros and cons of each and leave attendees with a solid starting point for their own explorations. Come prepared with questions, comments, and opinions as we'll have ample time for group discussion.

**Our featured panelists are:**

- Jeremy Carbaugh, a web developer at [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com)
- Shaun Farrell, a PHP developer working for [CACI International](http://www.caci.com) at the Library of Congress
- Tony Pitale, a web developer at [Viget Labs](http://www.viget.com)

This month's event is being generously hosted by the fine folks at [Fathom Creative](http://www.fathomcreative.com). They're located on 14th St. NW, near Rhode Island Ave. and is a short walk from Dupont Circle, Farragut North, McPherson Square, Shaw-Howard University, and U St. Metro stations.

If you're driving in, street parking around Logan Circle and on Rhode Island Ave. is residential, free, and unmetered. Unfortunately, the gallery space is not wheelchair accessible as it is upstairs without an elevator. Our apologies for any inconvenience this may cause.

**Fathom Creative tells us that we're free to bring in beer to share.** [Barrel House Liquors](http://www.yelp.com/biz/barrel-house-liquors-washington) is located conveniently next door. Fathom Creative will have ice on hand, so if you have a favorite brew, pick up some for yourself and others!

**The meeting will start promptly at 7pm**, but feel free to show up a little early. Afterwards, we'll be heading to a yet-to-be-determined local establishment for some socializing.

**We have a limited number of seats available, so we kindly ask that you only register for this event if you plan to attend.** In the event that you register and are unable to attend, please [contact us](http://www.eventbrite.com/contact-organizer?eid=1195049425) and let us know.

Let's face it: 3D on the web, WebGL, doesn't often emerge as a project solution. Why? Never done it before. It's outside the traditional design-build wheelhouse. Can't execute in time. It's scary.

_Nonsense._

The reality is WebGL offers another dimension (sorry not sorry) and opens a whole world of possibilities in interactive design. It can bring a touch of wonder to the mundane, let your project leap beyond user expectations, and free you to tell stories in ways you never thought possible.

Front-end developer [Eli Fitch](http://www.elifitch.com/) and designer [Maggie Gaudaen](http://maggie.is/) of iStrategyLabs lay out how they came together on their first 3D project, what worked, what crashed & burned, and how they created awesome as a team. Learn why WebGL isn't as intimidating as you might think, and why maybe, just maybe, you should give it a shot.

iStrategyLabs has also graciously offered to again host this month's meeting. Join us Thursday evening, April 23rd at their new offices in Shaw just a short walk from the Shaw-Howard University Metro stop. We'll kick things off promptly at 7:00pm, but come out early to socialize and grab a bit to eat provided by our sponsor, Celerity!

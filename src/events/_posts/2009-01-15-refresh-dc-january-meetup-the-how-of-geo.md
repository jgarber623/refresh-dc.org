Bring in the new year with a new take on an old practice. With great mapping APIs available to anyone for free today, mapping content has become something almost any designer or developer can do. Learn the how and why of geocoding, and how to design effective mapping interfaces for your web applications.

Andrew Turner is the CTO of FortiusOne, where he is guiding GeoCommons, developing geospatial-standards and building tools to make it easy for people to create dynamic, customized maps. He also actively participates in the open-source community and develops several mapping tools such as Mapstraction and GeoPress.

Andrew writes for O'Reilly and published the shortcut "Introduction to Neogeography" and "Where 2.0: The State of the Geospatial Web" business report in Spring 2008. He also publishes in MacTech and Make magazine on his home-automation hacking and brews a tasty porter.

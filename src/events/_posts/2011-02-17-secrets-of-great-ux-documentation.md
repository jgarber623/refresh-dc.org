Documentation is a cornerstone of the web design process. It helps move the design process forward, capturing decisions made or requirements learned. It allows the team to move onto the next set of decisions. Great documentation establishes a comfort level with team members, telling them, **"We have the same idea about where this project is going."**

In this month's Refresh DC, **Dan Brown**, author of [Communicating Design](http://communicatingdesign.com/) and co-founder of [Eightshapes](http://www.eightshapes.com/), will explain the evolving role of formal documentation in a design process that continually reinvents itself. He'll offer practical tips for making documents easier to read, easier to produce, and relevant throughout the design process.

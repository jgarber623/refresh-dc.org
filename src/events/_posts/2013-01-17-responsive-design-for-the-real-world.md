We're kicking off 2013 with a dive into Responsive Design!

You already know the basics, now learn more about the techniques and tools that make it easier to create a responsive website: frameworks and boilerplates, navigation patterns, CSS preprocessors like Sass/LESS, responsive images, responsive data tables, polyfills and plugins, emulators and testing tools.

You'll learn how each of these resources can help you build a better responsive website, and we'll delve into the code to see how everything works. Responsive design isn't as difficult as it seems: the secret is taking advantage of all the resources that are available to you instead of trying to solve every problem yourself.

Clarissa Peterson is a freelance web/UX designer & developer. Before setting off on her own, she spent 10 years managing websites at various nonprofits in Washington, DC. She's now working from the road while on an indefinite roadtrip (16 states and 2 provinces so far). Clarissa is currently writing a book on responsive design for O'Reilly, scheduled to be published in mid-2013. You can find her online at [clarissapeterson.com](http://clarissapeterson.com) and [@clarissa](http://twitter.com/clarissa).

We're meeting this month at [Capital One Labs](https://capitalonelabs.com/) in Clarendon. The meeting kicks off promptly at 7pm, but come by early for food and drinks sponsored by our gracious hosts!

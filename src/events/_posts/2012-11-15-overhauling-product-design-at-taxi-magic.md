Afraid to make a big leap with your product design? Concerned you will lose your best users, introduce bugs or make the product worse? In her talk, Michelle Olenoski will discuss the approach Taxi Magic took to redesign their iPhone, Android, and website products. She will highlight how to get redesigned products out-the-Â­door quickly with a focus on obtaining customer feedback, addressing pain points and iterating for future improvements.

Michelle is the Director of Product at Taxi Magic. She spent four years at Amazon with Amazon Instant Video and Mobile as a Sr. Product Manager. Taxi Magic, the leading mobile taxi app in the United States, currently operates in 50 US cities and connects to over 25,000 vehicles.

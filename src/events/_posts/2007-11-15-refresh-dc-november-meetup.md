For our last meetup of 2007, [Doug Wilson](http://www.onelittlewindow.org/) and [Mark Bristow](http://www.onelittlewindow.org/) will present a high level overview of why those developing web applications should worry about security. They will also provide suggestions for avoiding common vulnerabilities discovered in the past year.

If youâ€™re planning on attending, please send your name (and names of any guests) to contact at refresh-dc dot org. This will help us get a list of names to the door man. Thanks!

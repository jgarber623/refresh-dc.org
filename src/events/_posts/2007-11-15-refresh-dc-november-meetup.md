For our last meetup of 2007, [Doug Wilson](http://www.onelittlewindow.org/) and [Mark Bristow](http://www.onelittlewindow.org/) will present a high level overview of why those developing web applications should worry about security. They will also provide suggestions for avoiding common vulnerabilities discovered in the past year.

If you're planning on attending, please send your name (and names of any guests) to contact at refresh-dc dot org. This will help us get a list of names to the door man. Thanks!

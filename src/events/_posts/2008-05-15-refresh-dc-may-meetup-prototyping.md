Join us back on our normal night (but in Arlington again!) for a talk on Prototyping by Todd Zaki Warfel, President of Messagefirst, a design research firm in Philadelphia. Todd is the author of an upcoming book on Prototyping from Rosenfeld Media, and will not only give an overview of how and when to use prototyping as a tool in the IA/UX process, but also provide some techniques for the more seasoned veteran.

High-quality component documentation is a hallmark of an effective library. We describe each UI component robustly, aiming to drive effective design decisions and speed development. Good doc isn't free. It takes planning, effort, and process. In this talk, we'll take a journey through industry examples and effective norms so that you can annotate and elaborate on component examples and guidelines that make a difference.

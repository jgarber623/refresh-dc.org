We'll be back at the National Digital Library Learning Center (located in the first floor of the Madison Building - through the front doors and straight ahead) for August's meeting.

This month's presentation will be brought to us by Jackson Wilkinson of [Grassroots Enterprise](http://www.grassroots.com). He'll be presenting on Microformats, a hot (and sometime divisive) new means of tagging information in webpages.

If you have any questions, comments, or tips regarding Microformats, post them on our [forum](http://refresh-dc.org/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=148) and we'll address them in the presentation.

The closest Metro stop is Capitol South and you can find an excellent area map [here](http://refresh-dc.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=32#p119).

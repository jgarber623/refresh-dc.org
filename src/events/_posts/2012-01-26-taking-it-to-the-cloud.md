This month, [Rosalyn Metz](http://www.rosalynmetz.com/), a Digital Project Manager at [The George Washington University](http://www.gwu.edu/), will give us a brief introduction to the cloud. Additionally, she'll talk about some of the services that are currently available and about ways that your organization can use the cloud for deployment, testing, and development.

We'll be meeting at [Viget Labs](http://www.viget.com/) in Falls Church. The closest Metro stop is East Falls Church on the Orange Line (a short walk, bus ride, or cab ride from Viget's offices). Free parking is available in the garage of the building. Rosy's talk kicks off at 7:00 pm, but come by around 6:30 pm to enjoy some food courtesy of the fine folks at [Artisan](http://www.artisantalent.com/)!

A great way to transition into tech is to show employers what you're capable of. Side projects can help you do this, but how do you choose a project? How do you get started? This talk will guide participants through choosing a project that will be meaningful, motivating, and a good learning experience. Attendees will feel empowered to choose a project and learn how to prototype their idea.

[Shannon Turner](https://shannonvturner.com) is the founder of [Hear Me Code](https://hearmecode.com), an organization offering free, beginner-friendly coding classes for 3000 women in DC. Hear Me Code focuses on leadership development, peer mentoring, and turning students into teachers. In 2015, Shannon was named one of Washington’s Tech Titans by the Washingtonian. She currently serves on DC’s Open Government Advisory Board and on the DCFemTech leadership team.

It wasnâ€™t all that long ago that we made a giant shift in how we design and develop for the web. We slowly stopped using table-based layouts and switched to semantic markup and CSS.

Today we're facing another shift; making our websites responsive. Our processes, workflows, and tools break down when faced with an infinite array of devices, resolutions, and feature sets.

Designing from content, systematic thinking, separating layout from atmosphere, progressive enhancement, and project deliverables are just a few of the topics that Brandon Gray, a maker of awesome stuff for the web at AKQA, will cover to help you tame the modern web creation process.

The web is growing up fast, it's time our process grows up with it!

Join us on **Thursday, November 21st** for a special edition of Refresh DC at CHIEF's studio at **19th St. and M St. NW**. We'll be **starting at 6:30pm** (a little earlier than usual!), so be sure to show up early for food sponsored by our fantastic hosts.

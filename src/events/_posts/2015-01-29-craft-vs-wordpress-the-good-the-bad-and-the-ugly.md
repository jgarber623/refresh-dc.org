Kicking off 2015 in style, [Megan Zlock](http://www.zlockart.com/) will compare and contrast two content management systems: the established champ, [WordPress](https://wordpress.org), and the new kid on the block, [Craft](http://buildwithcraft.com/). After a short demo of Craft, Megan will go over the pros and cons of both platforms. This is a high-level talk addressing designing for, building with, and managing sites with Craft and WordPress, so all are welcome.

Megan is a front-end developer at [Viget](http://viget.com/) by day and a hobbyist illustrator by night. Although her most recent CMS-of-choice is Craft, she has extensive experience building and managing content with WordPress.

This month, we'll be returning to [nclud](http://nclud.com/), located at 1424 K Street NW. near the McPherson Square Metro station. We'll start promptly at 7:00pm, so show up early to grab a seat!

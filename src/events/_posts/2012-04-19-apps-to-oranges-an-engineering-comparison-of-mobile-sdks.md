This month we'll be going beyond the basics and getting into mobile development with a panel discussion. The three areas we'll be "picking" from include iOS (insert apple tree reference), Android, and Windows Smartphones.

The goal isn't to tell you which mobile SDK is the best (insert picture of genetically modified fruit), but to illustrate the pros and cons of each and leave attendees with a solid understanding of the current ecosystem. Come prepared with questions, comments, and opinions as we'll have ample time for group discussion.

**Our Featured Panelists:**

- Sean Soper, iOS Developer at [The Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com)
- Eric Mill, Android Developer at [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com)
- Ashish Jaiman, Windows Phone Architect Evangelist at [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com)

**Moderator:**

- Chris Clarke, Senior Product Manager at [Capital One Digital Innovation Lab](https://www.capitalone.com)

The meeting will start promptly at 7pm, but we'll have food & beverages (thanks to [canvas.co/work](http://canvas.co/work)) at 6:30pm.

This month's event is being generously hosted by Microsoft. If you haven't been to [the amazing DC office](http://g.co/maps/33655), they're located right by the Friendship Heights Mall and Metro Station (red line). If you're driving in, street parking is available and there's also plenty of paid parking at the mall garage.

Process and flow diagrams, even when well executed, can still be difficult to follow for clients unfamiliar with standard design processes. Illustrated storyboards offer design teams a method to present user flows in an easy-to-follow format that adds substance to a seemingly abstract process, helping to involve stakeholders more fully in the project.

This month, Karl Kaufmann will detail how he's successfully used visual storyboards user flows with clients. We'll be meeting again this month at Opower in Arlington just blocks away from the Courthouse Metro Station. The meeting starts at 7pm, but come early to enjoy food and beverages sponsored by our host!

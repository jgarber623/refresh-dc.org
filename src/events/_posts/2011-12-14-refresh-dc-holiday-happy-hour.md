We're closing out another great year with our annual Holiday Happy Hour! This year, we'll be gathering at **[Bread & Brew](http://breadandbrew.com/)** located at **1247 20th St. NW**. They have a fantastic selection of drinks and amazing food.

To help us celebrate, we've lined up some great sponsors to assist with the bar tab. The plan is to have a Refresh DC tab that we can enjoy until we use it up.

Thanks again for making 2011 a great year and we're looking forward to seeing you!

**Update: Supporting CodeNow**

We've lined up enough sponsors to make the Holiday Happy Hour a great time. If you're still interested in sponsoring, though, we ask instead that you consider donating to [CodeNow](http://codenow.eventbrite.com/?discount=refreshdc), a DC-grown non-profit focused on developing the next pioneers in technology by teaching underrepresented high school students foundational skills in computer programming. They're collecting donations for a bootcamp to be held at the end of December.

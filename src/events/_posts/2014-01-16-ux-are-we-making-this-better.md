In pursuit of creating the most minimal and intuitive interfaces, Interaction Designers have become masters of focus and flow. But at what point do we cease to improve experiences and start generalizing them? How do we avoid sacrificing invention for familiarity, making the world a more homogenous, less empowering place?

Join Huge DC's Experience Lead, Gabe Walsh, as he explores the oversimplification of UX in today's world, and asks the dangerous question of "Is it okay to be a Luddite?"

Gabriel Walsh is an Experience Lead at Huge. He has been actively producing and developing digital media for the past fifteen years. During this time he worked for the Danish toy manufacturing company, LEGO, on concepts and products that sought to inspire new forms of digitally integrated play. Walsh has also been a consultant on numerous online game and narrative projects for clients such as Science Channel, Pfizer and Pearson. While at the DC-based digital strategy agency, Threespot, he worked with philanthropic organizations such as the FINRA Foundation, the Knight Foundation and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. His personal creative work explores multi-platform narratives, such as his recent short film, card-game, concept-album and novella called Hoarding Eleven. Walsh received a BFA in Film from the State University of New York at Purchase. He teaches Multimedia Authoring at Johns Hopkins.

The event will be held at the nclud office. The meeting kicks off promptly at 7pm, but come by early for food and drinks provided by Huge!

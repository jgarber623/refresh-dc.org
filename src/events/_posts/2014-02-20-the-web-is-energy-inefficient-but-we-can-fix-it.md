Web designers, it's time to accept some unfortunate news: the Web is energy-inefficient. The overspending of electricity in our website designs has far-reaching consequences, has gone undetected for a long time, and permeates almost every pixel on the web. In general, people think about their energy consumption only nine minutes per year, so it's not surprising that we've been big energy wasters when it comes to web design.

In this month's talk, [Justin Secor](https://twitter.com/secor), Sr. Designer at Opower will show you much energy your websites and apps are using and offer practical, easy tips to help you earn your next rank: efficient web designer.

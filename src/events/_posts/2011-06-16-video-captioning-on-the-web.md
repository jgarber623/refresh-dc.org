These days, there's absolutely no excuse for not making videos accessible to the deaf and hard of hearing. This month's talk features front-end web developer and accessibility advocate, [Russell Heimlich](http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/) from the Pew Research Center, covering web video captioning. Join us at the AARP offices as he covers legal implications and a number of helpful tools and methods for making online videos more accessible.

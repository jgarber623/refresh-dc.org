[Justin Thorp](http://www.undercovergeek.net/), web application developer currently contracting with the [Library of Congress](http://www.loc.gov/), will be giving a presentation on accessibility titled "Understanding The Real World Wide Web and Why Web Accessibility Is Crucial." Justin will be covering different ways in which people use the Web, what you can do to increase the accessibility of your site, and how [WCAG](http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/) fits into it all.

The Motley Fool's offices are located on Duke Street just across from the King Street Metro station on the Yellow/Blue lines (take the tunnel!).

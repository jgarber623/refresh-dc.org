Can we gain a foothold in users' brains and make them feel awesome?

Find out from [Stephanie Hay](http://www.stephaniehay.com/), who'll join us this month to talk about user happiness. You'll see how intuitive designs, clean code, and clever content can go beyond traditional expectations to inspire emotionâ€”the ultimate outcome of our craft.

The meeting starts promptly at 7pm, but show up early to mingle and grab a seat!
